* FATE-locked actions are not included per the wiki guidelines. Feel free to add them locally for your character. 
* Prerequsites which are not consumed by an action are ignored.
* Rare results are ignored.
* 'Opening a bundle' redirects are not supported, such actions will not be included. 
* If the cheapest source of some item involves a cycles (e.g. Action 0: Convert 50 item A into 51 item B and Action 1: convert 50 item B into 51 item A), the price will converge very slowly. Luckily, while there are loops (e.g. cross category conversions), they are not the best path for item grinding.
* Skill check outcomes are not supported. Checks which my primary character can not fail are ommited, for other checks (esp luck checks), the expected values for outcomes are given for the stats of my primary. This frequently results in non-integer gains.
* For nontrivial skill checks with seriously bad outcomes (e.g. on rare cards, which are lost even if the skill check was failed), it makes sense to use second chances to square the probability of failure. This is not handled. 
* Quirks are not supported, actions which require *and* lower quirks will not be included. If the quirk is just a requirement or will just be changed by the action, it will be ignored. Banditry in the Upper River is treated the same. 
* Some combinations of actions on the best path to create an item might not work because of mutually exclusive constraints. Darkness levels, quirks and the like are always assumed to be (reasonably) optimal for the action in question. If an action in a grind lowers your Hedonist and another action depends on having a high Hedonist level, I have no way to catch that. 
* Methods to gain Favours are not included. Instead, it will be assumed that gaining a favour will require a card and an action, which is approximately correct.
* Some non-pyramidical qualities which have increasing costs, such as Notability or some of the aspects of a fake identity are handled (badly) by introducing level-specific Pesudoitems prefixed by "Meta:". 
* Actions which produce different items are hard to handle. For item action costs, we treat them as if they were different actions which only produced a single type of product. (If an action requires 5 item A and 3 item B, and another action gives you 5x A and 3x B, we will not find that action as the cheapest educt source. We only track the minimal action cost to produce each single type of item, not the costs to build a shopping list of items) For judging the overall appeal of an such actions, the total cost of an action can still be compared to the costs of acquiring all the products otherwise, e.g. the best case where you just want to get the items provided by that action with that fixed ratio. 
* The four basic menaces costs are tracked, but it's a bit of a hack. As we do not consider side effect gains to be relevant (see above), a gain of 1 CP Nightmares will be tracked as a loss of 1 "CP Loss Nightmares", which will be considered an educt, and thus the cost will be included.
* Challenges based on pyramidical qualities which are reset on success (e.g. Casing, The Hunt is On) are not included yet. If they are included, I will try to determine the sweet spot and calculate an expected action outcome for them.
* For a few actions, the amount of items gained depends on other qualities, such as Scandal or diving depth. I tried to pick a reasonable average value for these here. For complete favour loss (e.g. conflict cards), 7 favour is always assumed. 
* Some actions (research generally, but bone market and Helicon as well) are included as blocks. I tried to give as the action cost the expected value of actions required for the block. 
* Overhead actions, esp. travel by railroad, ship or mirror are only included when they are required for each item, e.g. Station VIII alchemy or parabolean research, but not parabolea hunting, as there is no reason to leave parabolea after hunting one.
* Real time constrained actions (e.g. per week: Nadir, Castellan, Bone Market Exhaustion) are not included.
* Some cooperation-style social actions are included. Here, the action costs of both parties are added. Naturally, one could always create an alt character (whose actions are unused otherwise, and thus do not really count) and pick a defect-style option.
