# we will only consider the faction gains here.
# other cards like An Afternoon of Good Deeds? will
# increase CtD as a side effect
# we will also ignore A Pocketful of Loose Change as
# it is typically not limiting in the long term
#
# We will charitably ignore the fact that you could use the card
# to increase Faction favours instead, so it has quite an opportunity cost.
#
# I will also ignore the restrictions on finding a home for your Mark
# actions, as they plainly do not seem to be worth it anyhow.
