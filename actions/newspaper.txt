# 13 actions to print
# one +8 and nine +12 increases gives +116 Foo Copy
# except for salacious, where "A column revealing certain facts about an acquaintance"
# gives +24 for 5 Scrap of Incendiary Gossip
# for mixed newspapers, we can always get to 128 Copy without the +24 option
# or to 140 with it (for Salacious content)
# From an EPA POV, theatric accounting option is only worth it if:
# * the reward does not scale with copies
# * we can gain 107 copies elsewhere
# which leaves the Expose of Paleontology
#
# Interception of scandal gives us two bats, so we use that when we need Salacious
# and do not qualify for theatric accounting
