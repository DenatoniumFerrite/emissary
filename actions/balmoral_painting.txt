# Paintings are difficult to handle, so we will do them in blocks.
# Next 3: Just make progress: (For 4 + anything)
# Note that we do not handle Persuation failures while painting.
# For Echo grinding, the most effective way seems to use 2 Moonlit
# e.g. from 2x woods of clay highwayman camp
# When painting 6x with Moonlight, at persuation 283 (0.84), the probabilities
# are: 
# 0.943  Lumi>=4
# 0.048  Lumi=3, Nostalgia=3
# 0.0075 Nostalgia>=4
# all of these options seem to pay 100 Echos
