# Kitchen

# There are two reasons to cook:
#  - To trade a specific dish (e.g. to Mr. Wines)
#  - To sell by ingredient value
# Both of these uses are, unsurprisingly, mutually exclusive.
# Consequently, I have two actions for every dish
# One which gives  Meta: Current Culinary Concoction <N>
# which can be traded, and one which gives
# Culinary Ingredient Value for sale.
