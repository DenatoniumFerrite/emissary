          The Emissary
       
         Fallen  London
  item grinding optimization
   for late game characters

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

With hundreds of items and thousands of storylets for the creation and conversion of items, the economy of Fallen London can be thought of as a great web where finding the best pathes is difficult. 

Just like his namesake on Saviour's Rocks, the Emissary is willing to guide you to your goal, be it Echos, Hinterland Scrips or Searing Enigmas.
